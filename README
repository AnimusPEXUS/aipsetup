== Some Basic Information ==

  Present AipSetup system in it's early stages was thought as Python's version
    rewrite, but power of Go language made it possible to extend it to be
    smarter and self-containier.

  Previous version was built with Python 3, but finally I had to discard Python
    from such responsive use: CPython realization and Python language it self
    is not good enough to be used for such purposes: Python language programs
    are hard to maintain, CPython have many problems, including CPython
    building and installation problems.

  The early one aipsetup was a number of bash scripts.. this can be found on
    SF.net here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/aipsetup/files/aipsetup/.

== Building and Installation ==

  This should be as easy as
    `go get github.com/AnimusPEXUS/aipsetup`

  aipsetup5 and aipinfoeditor executables should be built and installed.

== Development ==

  Running Makefile requires go-bindata installation:
