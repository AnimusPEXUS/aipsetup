= AipSetup =

  .. is system for creating and maintaining own GNU+Linux operating system.

  It can (Python version could, but, I hope, I'll finally find forces to finish
    this to Go rewrite):
   * mirror tarballs used in distro to local hard drive
   * build distribution packages
   * install and uninstall packages
   * build crosscompiler systems
   * creating bootable flash drive with installer

  Present AipSetup system in it's early stages was thought as Python's version
    rewrite, but power of Go language made it possible to extend it to be
    more smart and self contained.

  Previous version was built with Python 3, but finally I had to discard Python
    from such responsive use: CPython realization and Python language it self
    is not good enough to be used for such purposes: Python language programs
    are hard to maintain, CPython have many problems, including CPython
    building and installation problems.

  The early one aipsetup was a number of bash scripts.. this can be found on
    SF.net under same name.

  Both was hosted on GitHub, but I've considered those old versions too bad
    to continue providing them. If somebody wants to see them on GitHub,
    please, state so in Issues section.

== Building and Installation ==

This should be as easy as
`go get github.com/AnimusPEXUS/aipsetup`

aipsetup5 and info editor executables should be installed.
